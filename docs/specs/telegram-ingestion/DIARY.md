This file is an append-only historical log. It records implementation outcomes, validation, decisions, and follow-ups.

It is not the canonical source of requirements. Durable decisions must be promoted to canonical documents.

## 2026-05-04 — TELING-DOC: ARC Error Convention Alignment

Status:
- completed

Summary:
- Aligned Telegram ingestion documentation with the shared ARC error-code convention for terminal article-processing failures only.

Changes:
- Updated `SPEC.md`, `PLAN.md`, `TELING-003`, `TELING-004`, and the `TELING-004` ExecPlan.

Decisions:
- ARC codes are transported by Telegram terminal failure notifications when `jobs.error_message` already contains article-processing public failure text.
- Telegram webhook validation replies, authorization failures, acknowledgement failures, and Telegram delivery errors are not ARC-coded.

Validation:
- Inspected Markdown diff and searched for unresolved placeholders.

Follow-ups:
- Implement TELING and ARTPROC tasks according to their updated contracts.

Canonical Updates:
- `docs/specs/telegram-ingestion/SPEC.md`
- `docs/specs/telegram-ingestion/PLAN.md`
- `docs/specs/telegram-ingestion/tasks/TELING-003-worker-terminal-notification-contract.md`
- `docs/specs/telegram-ingestion/tasks/TELING-004-telegram-notification-dispatcher.md`
- `docs/specs/telegram-ingestion/plans/TELING-004-telegram-notification-dispatcher.execplan.md`
